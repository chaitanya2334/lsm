# Latent Structure Model
Model to construct material state transfer graphs from wet lab protocols by learning intermediate latent structures as described in [Learning Latent Structures for Cross Action Phrase Relations in Wet Lab Protocols](https://aclanthology.org/2021.acl-long.525.pdf).

# Setup
## Requirements
- python 3.7 (tested with 3.7.6)
- pytorch (tested with 1.7)
- transformers (tested with 3.1.0)
- matplotlib (tested with 3.1.3)
- hydra core (tested with 1.0.3)
- numpy (tested with 1.18.1)
- pandas (tested with 1.0.1)
- pytorch-lightning (tested with 1.0.4)
- scikit-learn (tested with 0.22.2)
- scipy (tested with 1.5.4)
- tensorboard (tested with 2.4.0)
- tqdm (tested with 4.43.0)


### Install all requirements
```
conda env create --file=environment.yaml
```
### Load conda env
```
conda activate lsm
```

## Convert Data
The [wlp-mstg-dataset](https://github.com/chaitanya2334/wlp-mstg-dataset) is provided as a submodule in this repository. However, it is present in the standoff format. It is necessary to extract all the actions, entities and relations from the standoff format and store them into json format for faster batching through pytorch's `Dataloader` operations.
```
python -m src.preprocessing.to_json
```

## Train and test the model

The configuration file `src/configs/igcn.yaml` contains all the hyperparameters used for the best model.
```
python -m src.trainers.igcn_trainer
```
